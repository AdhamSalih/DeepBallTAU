# DeepBallTAU
General
All codes were written using Colab, to use the file follow these steps:
First, Ask us (adhamsalih@mail.tau.ac.il or yaronhakuk@mail.tau.ac.il) for the related folder.
Then, you have to move/copy this folder to “my drive” from “shared with me”. Otherwise, you will not be able to load or save any model to the exercise folder.
In the Code, make sure that the folder is in the right place!!!!
The folder can be found on the Google Drive server in the following directory:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A7BxTW9Yp9ECzjdwZzw01NqLxEmeQ97x 
The project includes four notebooks:

1. ProjectDeepforBallDet 

2. ProjectDeepforBallDetWithRelax

3. ModelsEvaluation(excluding_MF)

4. ProjectDeepforBallDet_MF

and, data creation py file that has been used for converting images and CSV files into Tensor (Pytorch) Dataset.
# Train New Models
 
1. For training new DeepBall and C-DeepBall models  run the ProjectDeepforBallDet notebook.
2. For training new R-DeepBall and CR-DeepBall models  run the ProjectDeepforBallDetWithRelax notebook.
3. For training new MF-DeepBall run the ProjectDeepforBallDet_MF notebook sections: General setup, Dataset Loading, MultiFrame-DeepBall and Training MF-DeepBall.

# Evaluate trained models


1. For evaluating the MF-DeepBall run the ProjectDeepforBallDet_MF notebook sections: General setup, Dataset Loading, MultiFrame-DeepBall and Evaluate.
2. To evaluate other models run the ModelsEvaluation(excluding_MF).
